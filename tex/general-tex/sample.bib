    abstract = {We give several old and some new applications of eigenvalue interlacing to matrices associated to graphs. Bounds are obtained for characteristic numbers of graphs, such as the size of a maximal (co)clique, the chromatic number, the diameter, and the bandwidth, in terms of the eigenvalues of the standard adjacency matrix or the Laplacian matrix. We also deal with inequalities and regularity results concerning the structure of graphs and block designs.}

    abstract = {For a boolean formula φ on n variables, the associated property Pφ is the collection of n-bit strings that satisfy φ. We prove that there are 3CNF properties that require a linear number of queries, even for adaptive tests. This contrasts with 2CNF properties that are testable with O(√n) queries[7]. Notice that for every bad instance (i.e. an assignment that does not satisfy φ) there is a 3-bit query that witnesses this fact. Nevertheless, finding such a short witness requires a linear number of queries, even for assignments that are very far from satisfying.We provide sufficient conditions for linear properties to be hard to test, and in the course of the proof include a couple of observations which are of independent interest.},

abstract = {Abstract For every 1 > δ > 0 there exists a c = c(δ) > 0 such that for every group G of order n, and for a set S of c(δ) log n random elements in the group, the expected value of the second largest eigenvalue of the normalized adjacency matrix of the Cayley graph X(G, S) is at most (1 - δ). This implies that almost every such a graph is an ϵ(δ)-expander. For Abelian groups this is essentially tight, and explicit constructions can be given in some cases. © 1994 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},
