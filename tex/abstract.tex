\abstract{We propose a simple alternative construction of good LTC codes. In contrast to previews, constructions made by \cite{Dinur}, \cite{leverrier2022quantum}, and \cite{Pavel}, our construction does not require unique properties of the small codes, such as $w$-robustness and $p$-resistance for puncturing.
